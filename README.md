Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning using Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HiPPO) for MSc summer project


Plan:
1. Implement working SAC algorithm
    a. Make sure that it is compatible with gin
    b. Make sure that it works in CartPole in OpenAI gym
2. Build HIDIO
    a. Integrate working SAC algorithm into HIDIO
    b. Ensure that relevant functions and classes are gin configurable
3. Test in authors' environment
